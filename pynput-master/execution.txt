Requirements:
1. setuptools module in python
run the command "python -m pip install setuptools" in commmand prompt
2. also run "python -m pip install pep517"

macOs/Linux:
1.pip install setuptools
2.pip install pep517

In the terminal:
3. py .\setup.py
4. py
>>>import pynput
(if no error occurs then everything is successfuly installed)

ONCE YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RUN THE LOGGER.PYW FILE THERE IS NO NEED TO DO THE ABOVE STEPS AGAIN

Steps to run the keylogger in your machine:

0. Edit the log_dir = '<directory>' replace the <directory> with the directory of pynput-master folder

1.use IDLE or any IDE to execute(run) "logger.pyw" file or run it using command "py .\logger.pyw"

2. you can see that python file is running and the keys you pressed on your keyboard will be visible in "key_log.html" file.

3. to stop the process in windows command prompt use 'Get-Process' command
and find the pid of python and give prompt (Stop-Process <pid> -Force)

4. for mac os use commands ps , kill <pid>
